**Wow. Just wow.**

Last week I went to a Canonical Sprint, in Malta. The track was about the
Client, and we focus on how make the Ubuntu for Phones even better.

We discussed also about some new features and some new designs we will introduce
 in next weeks. Stay tuned! During the week I fixed many bugs, and wrote a lot
 of code.

But I think the Sprint isn’t (only) about codes and features. IMO it’s much more
 about networking. You know, we work mainly via IRC and mailing lists, and for
 how wonderful can be an online friendship, it will be never as drink some beers
  together!

So, first of all thanks to Canonical for the invite, and for the awesome
adventure I’m living in this last year.

But mainly thanks to all the guys I met. This week allows me to understand
that people I working with are not only cool as developers, but also awesome
as people!

We were 6 of community that joined the sprint: other than me, there were Nik,
my roommate, who is making clock app rocking; Victor and Andrew, which develop
the music app, Kunal, our wizard of calendar, and Adnane, who works on the
HTML5 SDK. It’s an honour to code side by side with these guys.

Then, there was the Canonical Community Team: Alan and David are my mentors,
my point of contact in Canonical, it was a pleasure to meet them and to have
a beer (or 2, maybe 3…) together! Michael is the man who keeps update
developer.ubuntu.com (and he does a lot of other things) and when I report a
bug I know that in five minutes will be fixed. Nicholas is a cool guy, but he
wants I use autopilot. No one is perfect. There was also Daniel. I worked with
him only for few patches in december, so I had no possibility before this week
to speak with him. And know what? He’s so funny! Last but not least, Jono: we
had some time to talk, and I’m very happy about this: thanks for all your work
in Canonical, and good luck for your future!

But all other Canonical employees were very gentle, and I met some guys which
I want to see soon, and now I know who ping on IRC to have a bug in the SDK
fixed ;-)
Also, other guys I used to know only on IRC (boiko, elopio, mardy, zsombi and
others) now have a face! And new guys, from Design and QA and online account
teams!!!

Was a wonderful week, and I have no words to say how much I’m happy, and to say
thanks to all!

So, thanks for all guys, hope to see you all soon, and continue to make
Ubuntu rocking!
