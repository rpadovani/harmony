One of the thing I appreciate most on Ubuntu Phones are scopes: they are a
totally new way to interact with contents. Unfortunately, after the presentation
of the BQ Aquaris I've seen a lot of bloggers saying *"Scopes aren't innovative,
Android has widgets for years"*.

My first reaction was *"C'mon, how could you say that? It's obvious that you
don't have tested them"*. Then I understood that, yes, we have to blame bloggers
because they talk about things they don't know, but at the same time we weren't
good enough to explain why scopes are so cool, and could be a game changer (but
they still need some work, as I'll evidence at the end of the post).

## Scopes

Ubuntu's scopes are like individual home screens for different kinds of content,
giving you access to everything from movies and music to local services and
social media, without having to go through individual apps.

I don't have a Youtube app, but I can see the best of Youtube without going on
internet.

![youtube scope][youtube-scope]

Basically, they try to find the best result for your queries. This is one of the
main differences with Android's widgets: **scopes have a search bar**, and they
update themself according to your search.

So I can see all Telegram messages I have about Ubuntu:

![telegram scope][telegram-scope]

Also, sources of scopes (so where they take their informations) aren't only
installed apps, but could be anything: a website, an RSS feed, the scope itself,
other scopes.

Another interesting feature is **department**: if you want you can split a scope
in departments, to have filters for informations. So, in the scope about near
points of interesting, I can look for taxis, or restaurants, or so on:

![poi scope][poi-scope]

I hope it's clear enough why scopes aren't widgets. If we want to find a
similarity in the Android world, scopes are like **Google Now** (but better).

## Google Now

*(I talk always about Android because I never tried a Windows Phone, or iOs)*

Scopes are like Google Now because, without any query, they both try to provide
us informations we need in that moment (on this side, Google Now is better
because it has more informations about us).

![home scope][home-scope]

But scopes will be better, because Google Now uses only one resource, Google,
while scopes could use every resource on the web.

At the moment, scopes miss some things Google Now has, like Flights search, but
it misses some things scopes already provide.

What? One of the biggest company on Earth doesn't have something a little
company was able to provide in just a couple of years?

Yes. **Because opensource always wins.**

And scopes are opensource, and could use any source they want. Google Now is
integrated with every Google app. Scopes are integrated with every app. So with
a scope I can search my Telegram messages, or my Evernote notes (not yet, but
we're working on Evernote scope).

But scopes don't win only about integration with apps. They win also on (some
atm, all in a future) searches. I love beers, so let's try to search for a good
*Orval*:

![orval][orval]

With a scope I have the result without have to open the browser.

Other than beers, I'm a developer, sometimes I need some documentation, let's
try to find how *print* works in Python.

![python][python]

A link to the documentation, thanks Google, very useful. What about giving me
the documentation itself, as Ubuntu scopes do?

And I can go on on this way for a lot of things.

Okay, I hope is clear my point here: the concept of scopes it the same of Google
Now, but scopes are opensource and more powerful, now we only need developers to
implement them. And a couple of features.

## What's missing?

Scopes are amazing, but I think they need a couple of things to became a
gamechanger in mobile world:

 - **Voice search**: voice search is critical nowadays: the less I have to look to the screen, the better is.
 - **Scope of scopes**: one thing I miss a lot is a scope that do searches in all scopes and returns me the best results. At the moment I have to swype to choose the right scope (like, for beers, untappd): I prefer to do a search, without swiping, and have the best result.

But this is only the start of a great adventure. We have room to improve.

Because, remember, on long run **opensource wins. Always.**

Ciao,<br/>
