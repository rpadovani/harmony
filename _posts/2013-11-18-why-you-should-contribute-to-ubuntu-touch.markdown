*I’m going to talk about Ubuntu Touch because is the biggest open-source project in which I’m involved, but the following post is applicable to any open-source project.*

If someone asks me which is the best part of being involved in an open-source
project, like Ubuntu Touch, I answer: **“The fun!“**. Seriously.


First things first: I did my [first commit][commit] to Ubuntu Touch on March 15,
2013, but it’s only since the beginning of July that I began to collaborate on
an ongoing basis. In these four months, I have achieved many goals: I have
become a developer of *ubuntu-touch-calculator* and of *ubuntu-touch-clock*,
I fixed more than 60 bugs and implemented a lof of functionality and, last but
not least, I took **Ubuntu Membership**. So, my experience is very positive and
I want to continue to collaborate to Ubuntu and Ubuntu Touch in the future.
And I believe that many people could collaborate with a open-source project,
so let’s move to the reasons why you should try to collaborate for yourself;

## Friends

> We’re all working together; that’s the secret!

Since I started I met a lot of awesome people, with whom I became friends,
rather than colleague. This is one of great thing of the community:
I can often have a chat just to know each other better.

The first day I joined on IRC I met ***nik90*** (Nekhelesh Ramananthan) and
***dpm*** (David Planella): Nik is a community contributor who develops the
Clock App: he helped me to fix some bugs and introduced me to fantastic world
of developement, showing me the tools and explaining the basic mechanisms
of contributing. David is *Ubuntu App Development Liaison* for Canonical, and
he is for me a very important person: always available and always with a word
of support or a compliment. He helped me to acclimate and get to know other
members of the team.

After I have joined the calc team I met also ***mihir_*** (Mihir Soni) and
***boiko*** (Gustavo Boiko): Mihir is another community contributor and we
worked together to create the final version of the calculator which is the
default in Ubuntu Touch, a very cool app! Boiko is an awesome guy who agreed
to be my mentor: thanks to him I learned a lot of thing about software
developement, group work and much much more. Thanks boiko!

I have encountered many other people who have given me so much like ***popey***,
***mhall119***, ***jono***, ***oSoMoN***, ***randomcpp***, ***balloons***,
***mefrio***, ***mzanetti***, ***me4oslav***, ***PaoloRotolo***, ***Letozaf_***
and many many more!

It’s nice to be part of such a great family that works for a common goal:
the users’ freedom.

## Knowledge

> Knowledge makes people special. Knowledge enriches life itself.

Collaboration with an open-source project gives you much more than what you
gives: contribute wrtiting code gives you knowledge. When I started with Ubuntu
Touch I didn’t know anything of QML. Now I think to be proficient in QML, and
I have improved also other skills, like group work, use *bazaar*,
code in Javascript, *“think like a programmer”*.

So, if you decide to collaborate to a open-source project, you’ll learn many
things that will enrich your cultural background and, maybe, one day will come
in handy. Not only code, but also mentality, visions of the world: meet new
people is always constructive.

## Fun

> Find a job you love and you’ll never work a day in your life.

To contribute on an ongoing basis to a project has to be fun for you: if you do
it grudgingly, or under duress, you will not like and this affected both the
quality of your work and your relationship with others.

I find in Ubuntu Touch (and Ubuntu Italian LoCo team) a project where I can
have fun: it’s a pleasure, for me, to return to home after a day at the
university and have the possibility to write code, fix bugs and so on.
The ambiance is nice: sure, there are deadlines and things less fun
(like *autopilot tests*, I hate to write autopilot tests :-P) but the result
gives a lot of satisfactions.

## A common goal

> Arise! Awake! And stop not until the goal is reached.

Another awesome thing of the project is the spirit that moves people: you can
see that is not only a work, but it’s a hope to do something good for the world.
Yes, a software is not the most important thing in the world, but the idea of
**freedom** is. So, in a market where the only company which works for
“*open-source*” is Google, the hope to do the difference is very strength.
And this is reflected in the quality of relationships: everyone is always
available to help you, even outside working hours, and there is a lot of
enthusiasm.

I talked about Ubuntu Touch because I’m involved, but I think the situation is
similar in all open-source project.
Some suggestion to start to contribute to a project:

- Know the people, make some friends, work together
- Find a project you like, there are endless open-source projects
- Search a field for contribute where you are good and you can be useful

Congrats, you are now a part of a big family, and you do something to make
the world better ;-)
