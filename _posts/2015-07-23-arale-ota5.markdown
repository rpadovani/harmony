One month ago I wrote my [first review][first] about Meizu MX4 and I was
disappointed about the optimization of the phone and some of the problems the
phone had.

Now, after a month, there is an update that makes the phone working as it should
have from the beginning. It's a shame they started to sell it before this
update, because a lot of reviews out of there are bad due its problems - now it
seems another phone.

## Meizu MX4 specific improvements

### Battery

One of the thing I most appreciated in the BQ Aquaris E4.5 was the battery
duration. Unfortunately the MX4 wasn't at its level. Until two days ago.

After the update I did a full recharge and I didn't have to do another one for
**36 hours**. Maybe for some of you isn't a lot, but for me it's much longer
than I was used to with Android. I always had *4G* turned on, I watched at least
30 minutes of videos on Youtube, I received and replied to more than 500
messagges, plus mails, surfing the net, a couple of calls and so on.

Battery life could be a killer feature of Ubuntu, and there is still a lot to
improve.

### Optimization

Now the phone doesn't lag and doesn't become too hot. And the new size of things
(*they change the value for a grid unit*) it's definitely better.

And now the led for notifications works! Yeah!

## General improvements

The speed of improvement is terrific: every time there is an update a lot of
things change, and you can spend hours finding all the differences. If you're
passionate about technology you definitely have to buy an Ubuntu Phone (the MX4
or the Aquaris only depends on the price range you are interested in).

Some of the most interesting I found:
- [Unity Rotation][rotation]: finally isn't weird anymore to use the phone in landscape mode. Unfortunately there is still a bug and dash doesn't rotate, I hope they fix it soon!
- [New icons][icons]: a great work by the design team: new icons are clearer and with a better resolution. Kudos!
- You can change reviews you left in the store! Time to update some old feedacks I left when some apps were still not so good as today :-)
- New tab in browser has been improved - this was one of the contributions I worked on in last months. I love webbrowser, and I love to see how many updates it's receiving, also on desktop!

Now I'm very happy with the phone, and I still miss nothing of Android. Yes, of
course it isn't for everyone (yet) but the number of improvements it has every
month is astonishing, and I think it will become product for the mass market
very soon.

But it still misses some apps, I hope some other big app company joins this
awesome travel!
