Those of you that are in my Linkedin's network maybe already known: since the
beginning of April I've a job. It's not in Canonical, unfortunately, or in any
other opensource project.

**But it's an amazing job.**

I started to work at [Archon Dronistics][archon]. It's a startup, seeking
investors, specialized in providing automated operations with drones.

**Fucking flying drones**. Something like this:

And these drones are driven by (our) IA. How much awesome is it?

## My job

So, I work at Archon as Frontend Developer: I take care of creating the control
panel for the management of fleets of drones, to assign them missions and
patrols.

Frontend is all in [AngularJs][angular], and we use a lot [Leaflet][leaflet], an
opensource Javascript library to manage maps. I hope I'll be able to use
contribute a bit upstream.

It's a couple of week I work with them, and I'm quite happy: I like AngularJs
and I love idea of drones. Have I already said how cool drones are?

## Ubuntu

I work part time, because I've also university to do. Of course, part of this
time is taken from the time I spent on Ubuntu. But don't worry, I will not stop
to contribute: you'll can read what I do in my monthly reports.

I gained a lot of free time stopping play Dota (I spent more than 660 hours on
it in 1 year), and I'll sleep a bit less. Because Ubuntu is too much important
for me :-)

Also, it's thanks to Ubuntu I've a job: I'm a student, so I don't have any
experience. But they see my contributions to ubuntu, and it's a great curriculum
vitae.

This is one more reason I should add to the article [*Why you should contribute
to Ubuntu Touch (or any other opensource project)*][contribute].

So, if you have any free time, do something for an opensource project: I'm sure
it will give you a lot of good things. At least, this is what's happening to me
;-)

Ciao, <br/>
