I’d like to give a big thank you to Ubuntu Community who paid for my entrance
ticket which let me take part in [CCCamp 2015][cccamp2015]. The Chaos
Communication Camp is an international meeting of hackers that takes place every
four years and organized by the Chaos Computer Club (CCC).

My experience was amazing from the people who I talked to and the people I met.

## Talks

There was quite a bit of talks so I’ll highlight some of them:

### How to make your software build reproducibly

Lunar, a Debian Developer, explained why it's important to make reproducible the
build of packages from source code. The main issue in the chain of trust at the
moment is we can read the source code of the packages we install, but we trust
third party servers where packages has been build. To make the things secure we
need to build packages in a deterministic way, so everyone could check if the
package was build from the source without editing.

While the problem seems easy to solve, it isn't. Debian has worked on that
problem for two years, and still haven’t completed the fix to this issue.

### How to organize a CTF

CTF - Capture the flag - are contests where the task is to maintain a server
running multiple services, while simultaneously trying to get access to the
other team's servers. Each successful penetration gains points, as well as
keeping services up and functional during the course of the game.

At the camp itself there was a CTF contest, and it's incredible how some people
could hack in a system and find vulnerabilities with very complicated way to
bypass security system.

### Towards Universal Access to All Knowledge: Internet Archive

Archive.org is a well-known service: their goal is to backup all the world!
Brewster Kahle explained how they're working to take as much data as possible,
and why it's important.

### TLS interception considered harmful

With the more widespread use of encrypted HTTPS connections many software
vendors intercept these connections by installing a certificate into the user's
browser. This is widely done by Antivirus applications, parental filter software
or ad injection software. This can go horribly wrong, as the examples of
Superfish and Privdog have shown. But even if implemented properly these
solutions almost always decrease the security of HTTPS.

The talk explains how bad some of these Software Companies are  which reduce
your security for their gains.

### Let's encrypt

Let's Encrypt is a new free and automated certificate authority, launching in
summer 2015.

In these dark times security and privacy are more important than ever. EFF,
Mozilla, Cisco, Akamai, IdenTrust, and a team at the University of Michigan are
working to make the web a safer place, adopting HTTPS everywhere. I really hope
this project will have a large adoption.

## People

As usual, the best part of events like this are meeting new people, listening to
different stories and acquire a common knowledge.  I'm not going to report them
here: lot of them value their privacy (at the camp there were 'No photos' signs
everywhere). I had an awesome time talking to people and learning new things
from them.

A big thanks to my travel friends, Ruio and Bardo, for their knowledge and even
more for their company in that long trip.

Also, a thanks to all the Italian Embassy - good guys, with a lot of free
grappa. Awesome!

## CCC Angels

The event is organized by volunteers so a big thanks goes to all of them, they
were able to provide energy and Internet for everyone all 5000 plus of us.

I want to say thanks again to the Ubuntu Community for sponsoring me, and to all
guys I met.

The next CCCamp is in 4 years, I hope I'll be able to join again, 'cause it's a
very strong experience.
