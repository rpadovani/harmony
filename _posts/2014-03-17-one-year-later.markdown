Lot of things has changed in last year in my life: I changed university, city,
I started (and finished) my first course on Coursera, I started to contribute
to Ubuntu and to write code, and I achieved the Ubuntu Membership and others
fantastic things.

But what happened exatly one year ago? Well, I [posted][post] this image in
Ubuntu community on Google+:

Seems like another era! How much work the community (and Canonical guys) have
done!
This was the first time I did something for Ubuntu, a screenshot on G+.
Since then I started to contribute to Ubuntu for Phones: few days later I did
my [first patch][patch] (nazi grammar patch :-P) and since July I started to
contribute on an ongoing basis.
It has been an exciting year, I did more than 250 commits for more than
10,000 lines of code; not bad, whereas I had never programmed before and I do
it in my free time. I want to continue on this way for long time :-)

But take a look on where we are. This is a screenshot on Ubuntu 14.04, on a
smaller screen:

Awesome! In only one year so much improvements!

The convergence strategy is fantastic, we’re building the future :-)

So, why don’t you start to [contribute][contribute] to Ubuntu?
