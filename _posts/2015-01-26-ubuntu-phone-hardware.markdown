[After a week][first], it's time to publish another mail I receive as *Insider*
for the launch of the first Ubuntu Phone.

In last month there were a lot of rumors and speculations (some of them were
very accurated), but now it's time to clarify: it's time to see what's
**the hardware** of the first Ubuntu Phone!

## The Hardware

Next up in this Phone Glimpse, we'll be shining the spotlight on our hardware
device for the Ubuntu phone.

We are confident and excited to be partnering with Spanish mobile device
manufacturers bq for the Ubuntu phone. bq is dedicated to designing and
manufacturing multimedia devices. It's six directors only formed seven years ago
where they met as telecommunications students who would repair computers in
their spare time. Today it's one of the top-selling tablet, e-reader and
smartphone brands within Spain that is continually spearheading innovation
notably with their entry into 3D printing and robotic kits. The company
developed the DIY: My First Robotics Kit in an attempt to demystify technology
by stimulating kids to start building their own robotic models. And their entry
into 3D printing with bq Witbox has been commercially impressive where they've
recruited leading professionals from Spain's printing and robotic sectors.

A strong innovative brand who operates in Europe with over 600 staff. With
mobile, in 2013 bq shipped almost 1.5 million devices and in less than a year
has become Spain's second biggest seller of unlocked smartphones. The Aquarius
E4.5 Ubuntu edition will be available in Europe and can be purchased soon via
the bq site.

Here are the core specs which you can see for real soon, at the Insider event!

- **Screen**: *4.5" qHD (960x540)*
- **Camera**: *5MP Fixed Focus+13MP Autofocus Dual Flash*
- **SIM**: *Dual micro sim*

Not long to go!
