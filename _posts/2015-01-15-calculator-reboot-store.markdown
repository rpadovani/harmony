[Bartosz Kosiorek][gang66], [Giulio Collura][gcollura], [Michael Zanetti][mzanetti],
and I worked hard on [Calculator Reboot][reboot] in last month, and finally it is
available in the Ubuntu Touch Store :-)

This is possible also thanks to [Alan Pope][popey], [Mihir Soni][mihir] and a
lot of other guys, designers and testers. I started to do a credits list, but
wow, how many people for a single app. So thanks to all!

The app is still being worked, so in next weeks will have new features and
improvements! Meanwhile, if you want to test it, just look for
*Ubuntu Calculator App Reboot* on the store, install the app and try it. It will be
installed side by side with the already available app, so don't worry, you can
test the reboot without losing the old one.

If you find any bug, please report it on [Launchpad][lp]. I'm sure there are a
lot of them, it's stll a beta, but we are here to fix them, so report them!
[Opensource rocks][ddg] because you can contribute to it :-)

In next week I'll keep you update on what's going on in the developement of the
calculator, until the reboot will replace the actual application.

## Help us

If you want to start to collaborate with us we will be more than happy to help
you in your first step :-) We need both developers and autopilot hackers. If you
want to write autopilot tests, we have a [list of bugs][autopilot] for you. If
you prefer to write code and fix bugs, [take the branch][branch], test it and
check what is missing! If you need help, or have feedback, write me a
[mail](mailto:riccardo@rpadovani.com) or join *#ubuntu-app-devel* on Freenode
and ping me (*rpadovani*) or Bartosk (*gang66*) or Giulio (*gcollura*).

Ciao,<br/>
R.

Do you mind to [buy me a coffee][donation] to work all night long? :-)
