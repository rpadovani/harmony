Hello all, <br/>
a week after the [first release of Falldown][first] I'm here to announce you a
new update for the game with some interesting new features!

But first of all, thanks to you all for downloading the app (350 users have
downloaded it so far) and for all positive feedbacks we received, both on store
and on the Internet.

But let me introduce the big news for this release...

![Falldown][img0]

## The news

Yes! We have settings!

Now there are two different ways to control the ball: with tilt, as usual, and
with touch, so you can play also while you're moving, like on bus.

Also, we added a slider so you can set the sensitivity you prefer: no more a too
fast ball that jumps away as soon as you move your phone :-)

Furthermore, some minor improvement including:
  - When you lost a life, powerups' effects are reset
  - Fix a bug where audio starts playing also if it's in mute mode
  - Some code optimization

## Translations

Thanks to community translators we added Asturian, Galician, and Hungarian
translations.

Also thanks to all the translators that are keeping translations updated. You
rock!

If you want to have Falldown in your language, feel free to help us translating
it [here][translations].

## What's next?

We have great plans for the future. Other than continuing to support and improve
the application, fixing bugs and adding some minor feature (like animations
between different screen) we're planning to insert two new big features, so
we're already working on version 0.3 (but expect some minor updates in the 0.2
branch before).

More news about new features in next weeks, but I assure you they're awesome ;-)

## New record

Oh, btw, do you know we spend a lot of time playing Falldown? I'm not very good
at it (my record is still 625) but Tyrel set the new record for the team,
**823**!

Congrats Tyrel!

And what about you guys? What's your record?
