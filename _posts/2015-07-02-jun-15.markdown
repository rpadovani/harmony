June has been a great month. A new Ubuntu device, the Meizu MX4, reached the
market. I wrote a [little review][mx4] about it, and now I use it as mainly
phone.

Also, I went to the Hello Tomorrow Conference. An incredible
[experience][htc15].

And last but not least, the [Discerning Duck scope][ddg] had an update.

But now let's see what I did in the last month for the opensource world :-)

## Donations

In June I received 5 euros of donations. I'll spare them to renew the VPS later
this year.

If you find valuable my contribute to opensource world, please
consider to make me a [donation][donation].

## What I did

In June I focused mainly on webbrowser. Now there are 8 branches waiting for a
review ready to land in the browser app, with little and big improvements!

I also created a new branch for Oxide, should be merged in next days.

Other than that, I did a lot of code reviews, both for the webbrowser, to have
the best experience possible, and for some core apps (calculator and reminders).

Also, I'm working on a new app that I hope to publish in a couple of weeks ;-)

If you like my work and want to support me, just send me a *Thank you!* by
[email](mailto:riccardo@rpadovani.com) or [offer me][donation] a beer:-)

Ciao,<br/>
R.
