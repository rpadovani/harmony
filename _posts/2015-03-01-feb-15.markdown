What a month for Ubuntu! First Ubuntu Phone has been announced and sales have
started! Finally, after two years of work, we will have feedbacks from real
consumers.

Also, on a personal level, it has been a great month. I went to London for the
Ubuntu Phone launch. I did laser surgery to my right eye to correct myopia (I
had 8 diopters), and in March I'll do the left one. And I also had time to do
some articles and a lot of code.

## Stats

First of all, thanks to all you who follow me, this blog has a number of
visitors I never expect. Without calculating who read articles on [Ubuntu
Planet][planet] or in a RSS Reader, this blog had **24,797 page views** by
**6,098 unique visitors** in 28 days. Thanks to all! And I only wrote 4
articles!

Stats are calculated by CloudFare, I don't have Analytics or others trackers on
the site. It just counts the number of request it has.

## Donations

More than visit, what astonished me is the number of donations: I had 3
donations for an amount of 30 euros! I'll use them to buy a VPS, so thanks to
all!

## What I did

Now, it's time to describe what I did in Feb. Considering the surgery, the uni
and the journey to London for the Ubuntu Phone launch I'm quite satisfied for
what I did.

### Browser app

I started to work, with oSoMoN, on settings for the browser app. I haven't a
timeline for this, but we did some progress, and in next weeks we'll land first
branches.

This is a screenshot on how it will appear the first version when we'll have
implemented all features we want for the first land.

### Calculator Reboot

We're working hard to replace the default calculator with the new one, news on
this side will arrive in next weeks

### Reviews

I spent a lot of time this month reviewing code of other guys, mainly for
reminders and docviewer app. Reviews are fundamentally for Ubuntu: every change
to the code has to be approved by someone after a careful review: in this way
we're sure we have a good codebase and a good implementation of things. Reviews
are very timeconsuming: you've to read and understand the code, then you have to
test it and think how the change impacts the user experience.

Other than that, I did usual things: bug report, some code for ubuntu-it,
promotion of Ubuntu on social networks, support on italian forum and on IRC and
so on.

Have you ever thought to help the Ubuntu development? There are a lot of things
to do, and you don't have to be a developer: we need translators, tester,
promoter and so. Try to take a look [here][contributions], and, if you have any
doubt, write me. I'll be more than happy to address you to the right place to
start to contribute.

You know, I'm a student and I do all this in my free time. So, if you like my
work and want to support me, just send me a *Thank you!* by
[email](mailto:riccardo@rpadovani.com) or [offer me][donation] a coffee :-)

Ciao,<br/>
R.
