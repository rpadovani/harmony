## New feature

Thanks to [Niklas Wenzel][nik] [Discerning Duck][ddg] has an update after months.
As you may know, the scope doesn't do a search on the web, but tries to provide you an Instant Answer, taking the information from various sources.
So some times scope doesn't provide anything useful to you, but maybe a search on DuckDuckGo could give you some result. Now there is a button *Search on DuckDuckGo* when no results are available, so you don't have to perform the same search again in the browser, but you only have to press the button :-)

## Call for developers

The Discerning Duck scope has a lot of potential, unfortunately I don't have enough time to develop it.
If you want to help me, drop me an [email](mailto:riccardo@rpadovani.com) or go on [GitHub][git] and leave a pull request ;-)

If you like my work and want to support me, just send me a *Thank you!* by
[email](mailto:riccardo@rpadovani.com) or [offer me][donation] a beer:-)

Ciao,<br/>
R.
