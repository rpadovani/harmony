Some days ago [OMG!Ubuntu announced][omg] the date of the release of first Ubuntu
Phone. That night I was in a pub with some friends, so I told them about the
release and the price of the phone.

All my friends present that night study in universities not related to tech, or
technologies. They know about Ubuntu only because I'm involved.

So, they wanted to try the system, and I was more than happy to show them my
phone. It's a Nexus 4 with RTM #12, and I use it as everyday phone, so it has
lot of apps and stuffs on it.

All feedback were more than positive, mainly on two topics:

 - **Fluidity**: compared to a phone with Android 2.x (*yes, there are some phones out of there with this old version of Android, sometimes it's very interesting how is technology out in real world*)
 Ubuntu on Nexus 4 is very very fast, and the same speed is on the BQ phone
 that will be sold in February (I tested it a couple of months ago, and it is
 awesome)
 - **Multitask**: the right to left swype gesture was greeted by applause. It
 is fast, cleaver, simple, and *everyone* wants it on every phone. Also other
 gestures were appreciated: after some minutes to understand how to go back
 (our brains are used to a physical button at the bottom) all guys seemed
 accustomed. But multitask was the most acclamate gesture, seriously

 Unfortunately, there are also two negative feedback:
 - **Unlock screen**: all my friends tried to unlock the phone doing a circle
 with the thumb, and all were disappointend to find that is needed a swype.
 There is a circle in the center of the screen, why do a swype?
 - **Whatsapp**: unfortunately, all them said won't consider to buy it until
 Whatsapp arrives. I know it isn't an Ubuntu fail, but Whatsapp was the most
 requested app.

Anyway, I'm more than happy with the results: Ubuntu Phone seems ready for all,
and this is a good point where we could start to build. We have simply to
continue on that way, and we will change the world, bit by bit, mind by mind.

Here my friends try Ubuntu on Nexus 4:
