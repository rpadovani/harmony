It's **Nov, 20th** again, and as every year it's time for the Ubuntu Community
Appreciation Day :-)

![uca][uca]

## The spirit of UCA

And, as the [wiki page][wiki] of the event says, Ubuntu is not just an Operating
System, it is a whole community in which everybody collaborates with everybody
to bring to the life a wonderful Human experience. When you download the iso,
burn it, install it and start to enjoy it, you know that a lot of people made
magnificent efforts to deliver the best Ubuntu OS possible.

For all the effort exerted, for every minute of the year, some gave of their
time talent or treasure. There's the Ubuntu Community Appreciation Day, when
everybody -- whether user, developer, or non-developer contributor anyone who
gives a hand making Ubuntu what it is today -- everybody takes a moment to thank
someone for their contribution. Every contribution counts! Take time to say,
"**Thank you!**"

The word **Thank You** inspires and gives a huge amount of motivation to
encourage people to become even better contributors thus making Ubuntu and the
community even better.

## Choose someone to thank

While a global thanks to all contributors it is a must, I prefer to thank
someone in particular, to show all my support to him/her.

Now, choosing someone is very difficult, because I met a lot of amazing people
in the Ubuntu Community, and a lot more contribute to Ubuntu in some way.

So it's a very hard task to choose someone.

Last year [I said][mzanetti] **Thank you** to _mzanetti_. I'm sure you know who
he is, and he totally deserves our gratitude.

As him, a lot of other Canonical employers - I was lucky enough to contribute
side by side with _popey_ and _oSoMoN_ and _dpm_ and _dholbach_ and a lot of
other guys, from a lot of different teams. To all of you, and you know who you
are, **THANKS**.

And then there a lot of guys from community, an I should thank each one of them.

But I want, for a day, turn the spotlight to someone who is not so well known in
the community.

I chose that guy because I think he's the perfect example of the perfect
contributor: someone who works hard, day by day, without seeking fame and glory.

And as him there are a lot of contributors: people who work hard to make Ubuntu
better every day. You never hear of them, but they are essential to create this
dream called Ubuntu.

To all of you unknown hard-working contributors, **thanks**.

And my biggest thanks goes to [Bartosz][gang66]!

## Who's Bartosz

I (virtually) met Bartosz working on the calculator app for Ubuntu for Phones.
Together we crafted the calculator reboot. But since the end of the Summer I
have no much more time to contribute to Ubuntu, and he's keeping the calculator
updated and bugs free.

He's a pleasure to work with him: he's talented and very patient, sometimes he
waits weeks before I review his code (blame on me!), but he never complains.

I know he also contributes to clock app and weather app and reports bug about
the experience on the phone.

So **THANKS Bartosz**, and keep up the awesome work :-)

Ciao<br/>
