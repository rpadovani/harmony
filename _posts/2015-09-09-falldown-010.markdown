Hello all, <br/>
I'm happy to announce Falldown hit the Ubuntu Phone market!

Falldown is a cartoon game where you have to tilt your phone to make ball fall
down quickly with rhythmic music. Don't get squashed!

There are a lot of different powerups and malus, they'll help you (or maybe
not...) to make a great score!

## The team

The game has been developed by Michał Prędotka, Tyrel Parker and me. We worked
on it in last two months, and we hope we was able to create a funny game for
everyone.

And we enjoyed working together, so expect other games in future by us ;-)

A big thanks goes also to mzanetti, kenvandine and Elleo for suggestions!

## Translations

Thanks to community translators the game, other than English US, it's available
in English (United Kingdom), French, German, Italian and Polish.

If you want to have it in your languages, feel free to help us translating it
[here][translations].

## Code and bugs

Code is available under GPLv3 on [Launchpad][code].

The game has been tested on Meizu MX4, Bq Aquaris E4.5 and Nexus 4, but we think
it could work on every official Ubuntu Phone.

If you find any bug, feel free to [contact us][bug].

## Donations

If you enjoy the game, please consider to make us a [donation][donation]. Please
specify it's for this game, we will use money to create other games ;-)

We hope you have as much fun playing as we had developing! And we have already
planned some updates, so stay tuned :-)

By the way, the record in our team is by Michal, 737.<br/>
Could you beat it?
