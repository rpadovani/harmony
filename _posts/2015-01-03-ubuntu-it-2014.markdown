[Ubuntu-it][ubuntu-it] is, as the name said, the LoCo team that takes care to
promote Ubuntu in Italy and to make available all resources (documentation,
support, the system itself) in Italian. The LoCo itself hasn't any resource - we
are all volounteer - and it isn't an association or any other recognized
institution, so we can't accept donations.

Our websites run on a Canonical server, and we don't have any other expenses.
When some of us go to any conference to show Ubuntu to the world, the expenses
are paid by the volunteer himself or, in the best cases, by the organizers of
the conference. Despite lack of resources what ubuntu-it could achieve is
awesome.

To have some idea on what is our audience, according to [Wikipedia][wiki], Italy
has ~61 million inhabitants, and in 2011 [54,5%][54] of Italian families had
access to the internet. Definitely a little market compared to the world.

## Events

In 2014 ubuntu-it organized two main events: [DUCC-IT][duccit] and a community
meeting.

### DUCC-IT

The **Debian/Ubuntu Community Conference Italia** is an event that wants to
unite the Italian communities of Debian and Ubuntu but also Italian
organizations working in Free Software, to exchange knowledge, discuss the
current situation and meet other developers and community members.

The conference had a lot of visitors, and the talks were pretty interesting,
mainly about Debian and Ubuntu, but also about [PostgreSQL][pgsql],
[Raspberry pi][pi] and others.

Organize this event is complicated and requires a lot of work, so thanks to
UIELinux and S.P.R.I.T.E for the help. We will try to organize another one for
the next year.

### Community meeting

In November we organized an event for the contributors, to choose what to focus
on until Ubuntu 15.04. The event was funny as usual, a day to drink beers
together and to work on our favourite distro!

## Some numbers

The 2014 was huge also about numbers: this year we focused on social networks,
because forums and mailing list aren't used so much anymore, and we need to
advertise Ubuntu where people are: social network, indeed. So we have a
[group on Facebook][fbgroup] with 3400 members and [a page][fbpage] with 7400
likes. Group itself is quite good, but our page needs more like - we have some
ideas for the new year, and we will try to boost it.

The thing that indicates how much our community works well is stats about the
website: it is static (we don't have news on it) so a user uses the website only
to download Ubuntu or to find informations on Ubuntu. Indeed, 25.32% of
pageviews are on homepage and 24.26% are on the download page.

So, in 2014 we had **2,256,985** visits by **1,525,845** unique visitors
(*65.84% are new visitors*) that have visited **7,237,480** pages.

In 2015 we're planning to launch a new version of the website, mobile ready
(sorry, we're very late on this, but you know, we do it in our little free
time).

With the launch of the new website and of Ubuntu Phone in February
([and with a lot of people interested in it][oldpost]) I think we can do bigger
numbers, and I hope we will have a fantastic year in the Free Software world.

Ciao, <br/>
