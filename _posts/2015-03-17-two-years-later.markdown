In three days firsts Ubuntu phones will be send to real users, people who paid
to buy them. It's amazing and exciting, and it's incredible to think that a
little company as Canonical was able to create a OS for smartphones in two
years.

But what happened on March 17th, 2013?

Well, it's incredible to say looking to what I'm doing now, but there was my
first contact with international Ubuntu Community. I [posted][post] this image
in the Ubuntu community on Google+:

Seems like another era! How much work the community (and Canonical guys) have
done since then! Then I started to contribute to Ubuntu for Phones: few days
later I did my [first patch][patch] (nazi grammar patch :-P) and since July I
started to contribute on an ongoing basis. It has been two exciting year, I did
more than 660 commits for more than 65,000 lines of code; not bad, whereas I had
never programmed before and I do it in my free time. Plus, I made one app, one scope, I joined a couple of Canonical Sprints. I really hope write code will soon become a job for me :-)

But take a look on where we are. This is a screenshot on Ubuntu 15.04, on a
smaller screen:

Awesome! In two years so much improvements! And calendar has the desktop mode!

Just to do a compare, take a look on the same screen last year:

We’re building the future :-)
