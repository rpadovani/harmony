10 days ago I switched my phone, I dismissed the [BQ Aquaris E4.5][bq] and
started to use the [Meizu MX4][meizu] (both with Ubuntu for Phones). On Internet
there are a lot of reviews about hardware and software, written by people more
prepared than me and in a better English. What I want to do here is to highlight
how it fits my user case and why it's 9 months I don't use a smartphone if it
doesn't have Ubuntu.

## A couple of premises

I use Ubuntu as only system on my smartphone since Sep '14. I started with a
Nexus 4, until Feb '15, when I switched to the BQ Aquaris, and then to Meizu MX4
a couple of weeks ago. All three devices have been given to me by Canonical, the
company which develops Ubuntu, to thank me the support in the development of the
system.

Despite this, they didn't ask me to do a good review, or else, but just to be
honest. And I'll do, as [I did][feb] back in February.

Also, I'm happy with Ubuntu, but that doesn't mean it is the best system on the
market (*hint: it isn't*), or it has the best hardware (*hint: it hasn't*), or
the best applications (*hint: no way*). But I like it, I love to improve it, and
I'm so happy there is an opensource system on the market (yes, there is Firefox
OS too, but I prefer Ubuntu). So don't buy it if you aren't sure about what
you're doing.

## The good

### The screen

The screen of this phone is something so beautiful, so perfect, so *whatever
positive adjective you can think*, that I fall in love with it. It was the
worst thing on the BQ, and it's the best here: lateral borders are little, the
screen is big, there are so much pixels you don't see them, and everything is so
perfect sized. You know, *size matters* ;-)

### The performances

It definitely has better performances than the BQ. Especially browser and
Telegram.  Browser has a very fast rendering, and Telegram is so better than on
the BQ that I'm not sure it is at the same version on two phones. I asked to
developers and they said yes, but I swear I'm not convinced yet, it's definitely
faster, it never freeze, and it's really nice to use it.

And no, it's not because I use it little. In fact, I receive more than 500
messages every day (guys, to abandon Android I had to persuade all my friends to
switch to Telegram).

### The system

I really love the system: good performance, long battery life, every time there
is an update you see so many changes, and I help to shape it writing code (and
this is one of the greatest satisfactions that there may be).

After the last update *OTA-4* it's a wonderful world where to live, and it's
**opensource**. And this is the fundamental thing.

## The bad

### The optimization

Considering how smoothly Ubuntu runs on the Aquaris, I definitely expect better
things from this phone. I have to recharge it every day (while I was recharging
Aquaris one every two days) and sometimes the system freezes. Developers are
working on all the bugs, so I'm sure they will be fixed and in future the
optimization will be better, but the system is definitely better optimized for
the Aquaris than for the MX4

### The price

Considering the hardware, the maturity of the system and the optimization (*see
above*) it's overpriced. While I suggest you to buy the Aquaris if you want to
try Ubuntu, I cannot suggest to buy this one. At least, until another update fix
all issuses I highlighted before.

I really like the screen, so I'll continue to use this one, but if you aren't
huge fans of large screens, there is no reason to buy this over the Aquaris at
the moment I'm writing (end of Jun '15), but I hope the situation will improve
with OTA-5 (ETA: end of Jul '15).

### The home button

**We don't need buttons**. More screen and less buttons, please.

## The dream

Canonical and community are working together to make a dream possible. We want
opensource runs the world, we want to create a better place with software.

I don't know if we will be successful, or if we will change the world, but at
least we're trying. So don't settle down, continue to write code, report bugs,
translate apps. At the end, good deeds are always rewarded.

As Alan Kay wrote, *The best way to predict the future is to invent it.*

Someone says I'm wasting my little free time doing things for free for a
commercial company. But I'm not wasting my time, I'm building a better future,
and so do you every time you do something for the opensource world.
