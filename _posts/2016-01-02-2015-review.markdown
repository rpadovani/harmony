Hello all, and first of all happy 2016 to you all!

I hope it will bring to you all happiness you deserve :-)

2015 has been a great year for me on a personal plan - I had to fight some
battles, and I had ups and downs, as everyone I suppose. But I'm sure that so
far has been the most amazing year I had. Even better, it laid the foundations
for an even better 2016.

## Ubuntu

I think 90% of readers of this blog are interested about Ubuntu, so I think is
important to highlight how awesome has been this year for the project I was most
involved in: **Ubuntu Phone**.

The first Ubuntu Phone [hit the market in February][0]. Others two phone
[arrived in June][1]. And thanks to a lot of updates, [they improve][2] each
month.

I'm very proud I have helped a little bit this awesome project. And with
[Mivoligo][3] and [Tyrel][4] we created one of the most loved games for Ubuntu
Phones: [Falldown][5].

## Donations

In 2015 I received 128.55 euros in donations. This is mind-blowing, when I added
the paypal [donations form][6] [one year ago][7] I could never imagine a so huge
support, so thanks you!

Also, for Falldown we received 140 euros of donations. We spent some of them in
Germany for UbuCon Europe, and we'll see how to spend others to provide a better
game (or new games) :)

## 2016

2015 has been an amazing year, and it's incredible to look back and see how many
things changed!

What's the plan for 2016 then? Well, if you followed me you know I have a
[little job][8] now, and I'm very happy with it and it gives me some [big
satisfactions][9].

While during summer I was able to do my job and do some opensource
contributions, unfortunately in September I restared university and I haven't
found yet a way to do as many contributions as I used to.

So in 2016 I hope to find a way to do all the things I love, I would love to
release a couple of updates for Falldown and do other things. But the first
thing to do for me is finding an equilibrium in my time to do all the things I
care about.

I hope you all will have an awesome 2016!

Ciao,
R.
