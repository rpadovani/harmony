Just a couple of days ago I [said][post] how much rocks opensource and
DuckDuckGo Team. And since today there is integration between DuckDuckGo and
[Launchpad][lp] bugs.

![launchpad on ddg](http://img.rpadovani.com/posts/lp-ddg.png)

## How does it work?

It's very simple to use, just type *lp #number* and you will see a summary of
the bug with a link to Launchpad. It's very useful: how many times someone on
IRC write a bug number but doesn't write the link? Now you can simple paste the
number on DuckDuckGo and you know what bug it is. So cool!

## Credits

Thanks to all the DuckDuckGo team for the implementation, but mainly to the
original developer: [Giovanni Bucci][puskin]. He started his travel in the
opensource world since a couple of months, so go to say thanks :-)

## Discerning Duck

Unfortunately this new functionality will not be available on Discerning Duck -
my scope for Ubuntu Phone. At the moment DuckDuckGo API provides only *goodies*
(things that don't require third parts API), and Launchpad is a *spice*.
DuckDuckGo team said they will provide spices too to third parts app, so I hope
we could have them soon.

You don't use DuckDuckGo yet? It's time to change! You can see [here][donttrack]
why it's the best search engine. I use it as main search engine since one year,
and it's very useful. And it respects your privacy!

Ciao, <br/>
R.
