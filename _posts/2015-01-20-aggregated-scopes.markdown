Next Feb, 6th there will be a Canonical event in London, where firsts Ubuntu
Phones will be presented to the public. I'm one of the lucky guys will join the
event and will have the opportunity to have one of this little treasures - so
next month I'll do a lot of posts about it :-)

Meanwhile, Ubuntu Phone Teams is writing to the participants of the event some
details about the phone and the system. It isn't anything secret, but these
mails give some good informations on the phone. I think *information wants to be
free*, so I share them with the world.

![Aggregated scopes](https://img.rpadovani.com/posts/aggregated-scopes.jpg)

[In our initial Phone Glimpse mail][first] we'd introduced scopes for the Ubuntu
phone - an integrated approach to delivering content and services. We touched on
aggregated scopes that are default scopes valuable to end users. In this mailer
we'll be showcasing the default scopes available that provide a full spectrum of
rich content categories.

The Today scope let's you see your most important interactions on one screen.
Personalise it to see what's most important to you, right at your fingertips.

To see local information, events and services from wherever you are located,
check out the NearBy scope. Imagine you're in Barcelona yet don't know where to
eat, the NearBy scope will provide you with hidden gems from various sources. A
few app partners include: TimeOut, Yelp and The Weather Channel.

The all important News scope aggregates news feeds from your chosen providers
that includes the BBC, EuroNews and Engadget.

Bringing music to you. The Music scope allows you to see music on your phone and
the web within one place, be it your music library, streaming content from
Soundcloud or Grooveshark, and maybe tracks purchased from 7Digital.

There's also the Video scope with app partners that include YouTube, TED and
Vimeo, as well as the Photo scope that brings your Facebook, Instagram and
Flickr feed into one place.

Every source in the aggregated scopes can expand to give you an app-like
experience for that source - and by starring it, they can even become another
default screen. That's a great way to personalize your Ubuntu phone so it truly
revolves around the services you use most.

There's also a scope dedicated to traditional apps where you can see your
downloaded apps in one place.

Voila! A content rich experience brought to you which we can't wait to showcase
for real at the Insider event. As mentioned in earlier mails this information is
yours to use in anyway!

Looking forward to sharing more insights with you.

Best, The Ubuntu Phone Team
