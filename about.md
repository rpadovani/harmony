I'm Riccardo, student in Computer Science University of Ferrara, Italy.

I'm an open source enthusiast, and in my free time I collaborate with Ubuntu
Community. I think is very important as project to spread free software in the
world, on every type of device.

At the moment I focus mainly on Ubuntu for Phones, but I contributed to a lot
(maybe too many) different projects, with patches and bug reports.

When I'm not busy with university or Ubuntu, I enjoy a beer with friends.

### Side projects

- [100 Balls][100balls]: An open-source clone for Ubuntu for Phones of 100
Balls, based on Bacon2D
- [Discerning Duck][discerningduck]: A Ubuntu scope to query DuckDuckGo

### Ubuntu contributions

It's pretty impossible (and useless) link all projects I contributed to,
so I just list projects I'm involved on daily basis at the moment.

- [Ubuntu Core Apps][coreapps]: developer, tester and early adopter (mainly
[Reminders][reminders] and [Calculator][calculator])
- [Ubuntu Italy Website][ubuntuit]: administrator and developer
