I'm an universitary student, and I have no incomes. So if you enjoy one of
my contributions to the opensource world, please think about offer me a beer :-)

Every month I'll do a post about what I did in opensource world that month,
so you could know how I spent my time, and if I deserve a beer or a coffe.
Also, I'll publish the amount of donations I received in the previous month.
